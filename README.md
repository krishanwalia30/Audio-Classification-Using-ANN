# Audio Classification Using ANN

This project used Artificial Neural Network to classify audio files based on different classes.

## Feature Extraction

The feature extraction from the audio files is done using the MFCC method.

The library used to process audio files is **LIBROSA**

The accuracy of the model after training is 0.7916428446769714

The model performed suitably against new datasets gathered from various sites.
